# How to Contribute

All of the [instructions for contributing from the main repository](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) apply, and won't be repeated here. You simply need to change references to `caskroom/homebrew-cask` (that repository) to `caskroom/homebrew-versions` (this repository).
